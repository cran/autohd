Description: Perform mediation analysis for time to event high-dimensional data.
             Mediation Analysis proposed by Miocevic et al.(2017)  <doi:10.1080/10705511.2017.1342541> 
             as a statistical tool in the Bayesian framework. 
             Time to event data analysis methods like Cox proportional hazard model, 
             accelerated failure time model to work with high dimensional data 
             with Bayesian approaches are provided. Missing data imputation techniques tool
             to work with high dimensional data coupled for mediation analysis by 
             presented by the active mediator variables.
